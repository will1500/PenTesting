Attack Narrative 

The FristiLeaks VM has a goal to get root access. Through scanning the machine i found access to usernames and password. A remote attacker could use this information to escalate privileges and get root access to the machine. PHP. Apache are out of date, HTTP, methods are allowed which could lead to cross site scripting  

Attack narative
First i ran a basic scan of nikto -h (ip) showed me an outdated apache server of 2.2.15 and outdated  PHP version of 5.3.3. PHP should be updated to at least version 5.6.9, and Apache should be updated to at least 2.4.12. A basic nmap scan showed me a server was running on port. The site was a picture that read The # fristileaks motto: Keep calm and drink fristi. Running a dirb scan showed me a robots.txt directory showing the directories /cola, /sisi/ and /beer/. To further exploit this, 10/12(look this up) walkthroughs either guessed to go to /fristi directory by guessing or a brute force wordlist. This is as far as i got alone and followed the walkthroughs to fully exploit the machine. 

Exploits 
This version of PHP 5.3.3 is vulnerable to CVE 2011-488 which a a denial of service attack. This attack can cause a server to consume hours of CPU with a single HTTP request.  Using metasploit auxiliary/dos/http/hashcollison_dos i was able to send several http request(about 50). 
With the old Apache server i successful used the Apache Range Header Dos (Apache Killer)  in Metasploit to send Dos packets to the server. I was able to send as many as i want(sent 1000) to the network.  I ran ether ape to see the screen light up completely red to confirm my packets were sent successfully. 
Exploits in the making:
metasploit web delivery payload to get a reverse shell.
