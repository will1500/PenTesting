Attack Narrative\
First i ran an nmap scan of nmap -sS -sV -Pn -p- 10.0.0.156. -sS stands for(explain all these)\
From this scan i discovered several open ports. The most critical open ports were ports 21(ftp) and ports 22(ssh). These ports can lead to remote access to the information leading to confidential information access. Medium critical ports were ports 3306 and 12380. Port 3306 ran a mysql 5.7 server on a Ubuntu OS. Port 12380 ran an Apache 2.4.18 server on Ubuntu as well. Both of these servers are out of date, and vulnerable to exploits. PATCH PATCH PATCH. Other less critical open ports are 53(dnsmasq 2.75), 80(http), 139(netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.x - 4.X), and 666 (doom). \
\
Next i ran dirbuster with the command:  dirb https://10.0.0.156:12380 -R. T\
Directories of interest found were https:/10.0.0.156:12380/announcements/, index.html, javascript, phpmyadmin, robots.txt, and server-status. }
